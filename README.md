# Web-app for voting a pokemon with roundest shapes

This is a toy project where i learn how to use several full-stack web tools:
[x] building frontend in React
[x] setting up backend with next.js
[x] setting up a serverless MySQl database
[x] using prisma ORM for database interface
[x] deploying the web-app to online on vercel

I could spend more time improving the styling of components but the overall functionality is there and the project is thus finished. Learnign objectives acomplished.
